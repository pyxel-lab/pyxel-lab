# Protocol - 1. May 2018

I tend to be overly ambitious trying to come up with an impressive solution that's generic and powerful without exploring the basics first. In the last few days I've been thinking about different programming models with similar design goals as [Realtalk](https://dynamicland.org/research-notes/social-dynamics-of-programming-together/) getting lost in details without coming to a satisfying realisation. I think that's the wrong approach right now. Instead I want to take a step back and see what's possible to build with the features which are already available in Paper Programs. The goal is to build up a set of increasingly complex examples to give an introduction to Paper Programs similar to this [binder in Dynamicland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvHddfHX9hc).

## Tutorial attempt

```JavaScript
// Hello World
importScripts('paper.js');

(async () => {
  // Get a canvas object for this paper.
  const canvas = await paper.get('canvas');
  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

  // Set font styling 
  ctx.font = '15px sans-serif';
  ctx.textAlign = 'center';
  ctx.fillStyle = 'red';

  // write 'Hello World' in center of paper
  ctx.fillText("Hello World!", canvas.width / 2, canvas.height / 2);
  
  // commit drawing instructions to display
  ctx.commit();
})();
```

Ok this idea totally failed which is okay. I've realized building this tutorial is also going one step too far, because I don't truely understand yet what Paper programs as a medium can do. I should go back to the previous mode to just build demos and see what happens.

## Idea: Build physical jump and run

- Use camera to "see" paper
- Color black => solid ground, don't fall
- Use Markers to set target point, and coins

This session ended kind of disapointingly. I got stuck on getting the camera api to run: https://github.com/janpaul123/paperprograms/issues/55
